# UADD
This is the final part of the BDD + TDD + UADD framework.

Pre-requisites - Node.JS - https://node.org, fitnesse, SlimJs

If you have followed the initial two parts -  BDD - https://github.com/ravichandranjv/BDDWithSlimJS and TDD - https://github.com/ravichandranjv/TDDWithMocha, all that needs to be done in this part is to remove the "scenario table" from the slimjs script and that is it - UADD is done!
